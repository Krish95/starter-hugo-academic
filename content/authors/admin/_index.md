I am a Prime Ministerâ€™s Research Fellow (PMRF) pursuing Ph.D. in the Department of Computer Science and Automation at the Indian Institute of Science.

I am fortunate to be advised by Prof. Y. Narahari and Assoc. Prof. Siddharth Barman.

My research focuses on fair division of indivisible goods in a multi-agent setting.
